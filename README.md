# Alohomora API

## What is this ?
The Alohomora API is the server-side for the password manager. Built on top of Symfony using a GraphQL API scheme, it enables the user to hosts it's own instance of the server on any host capable of handling Symfony (URL rewrite if you are using nginx, or .htaccess on apache)

## How to install ?
Just extract it in your web folder. Configure your host to works with Symfony and go to your website URL to be prompted with an installer.
